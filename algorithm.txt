Algorithm for python file :
Step 1 :-
              List/Filter only python files
              Expected Result :    y.py
                                             
              
Step 2 :-
              Find a 'Name' of that Python Files
              Expected Result :    y
                                            
Step 3 :-
              Create a new folder with same name as a file-name
               Expected Result : y/

Step 4 :-
              Create a new subfolder with same name as a file extension-name
               Expected Result : py/

Step 5 :-
              Cut a original python files & paste into a specific same extention folder




Algorithm for javafile :
Step 1 :-
              List/Filter only java files
              Expected Result :    x.java
                                             
              
Step 2 :-
              Find a 'Name' of that Python Files
              Expected Result :    x
                                            
Step 3 :-
               Create a new folder with same name as a file-name
               Expected Result : x/
Step 4 :-
              Create a new subfolder with same name as a file extension-name
               Expected Result : java/

Step 5 :-
              Cut a original x.java files & paste into a specific same extention folder
              



Algorithm for javascript file :
Step 1 :-
              List/Filter only Javascript files
              Expected Result :    z.js
                                             
              
Step 2 :-
              Find a 'Name' of that Javascript Files
              Expected Result :    z
                                            
Step 3 :-
               Create a new folder with same name as a file-name
               Expected Result : z/

Step 4 :-
              Create a new subfolder with same name as a file extension-name
               Expected Result : js/

Step 5 :-
              Cut a original javascript files & paste into a specific same extention folder
